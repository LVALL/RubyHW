# **Welcome to my "Tamagothi" game interpretation**
this game is created for people who can't get themselves a pet 
in the real world, but really want to take care of someone 
(yeah, yeah, exactly, I'm talking about people like me).
## How to start game?
all you need to do is run command in terminal such as:
```bash
ruby /home/valera/Документы/GitHub/RubyHW/HW2/tamagotchi/game.rb
```
## Rules
Yes, I almost forgot to write the list of rules, because I seem it so boring
* MAIN rule is don't let your pet die, how will you do it - not my problem )
