# **Welcome to my "Tamagothi" game interpretation**
This game is created for people, who can't get themselves a pet 
in the real world, but really want to take care of someone 
(yeah, yeah, exactly, I'm talking about people like me).
## How to start game?
All you need to do is run command in terminal like this one:
```bash
ruby /home/valera/Документы/GitHub/RubyHW/HW3_2/modified_tamagotchi/game.rb
```
The game window will open in your browser, as soon as you create your pet in terminal.
## Rules
Yes, I almost forgot to write the list of rules, because I seem it so boring
* MAIN rule is don't let your pet die, how will you do it - not my problem )
* Use terminal hints and commands to do something with your pet
## How it looks
